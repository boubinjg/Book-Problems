log*(log(n)) is larger than log(log*(n)).

for a number, n, log*(n) produces a very small number, much smaller than log(n).
log(n) of a given number, say 65536, will generally be significantly larger than 
log*(n). 16 compared to 4. log* of 16 (3), is larger than log(4) (2). generally,
putting the more highly scaled function on the outside of the lower-scaled function
produces a larger result.
