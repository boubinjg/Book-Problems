For constants a and b, and input n (n+a)^b = T(n^b).

T(g(n)) is the bound of the function f(n), where for constants c1 and c2,
c1*g(n) <= f(n) <= c2*g(n)

simply adding constant a to the input size n and applying the exponent b has the same effect
as multiplying (n)^b * c where, if n is larger than a, c is a fraction of the input size to b.
Because we are assuming an arbitrarily large input size, we can assume that c will always be less than n^b
so n^b will be the larger term.
