the intersect of o(f(n)) and w(f(n)) is the empty set. o(f(n)) is the set of all functions which are
non-asymptotically tight upper bounds on f(n), and w(f(n)) is the set of all functions which are 
non-asymptotically tight lower bounds on f(n). 

These non-tight bounds mean that w(f(n)) or o(f(n)) can't be multiplied by an arbitrary constant such that
c*w(f(n)) = f(n), same with o. This means that the functions constituting the set w(f(n)) are all lower order
than f(n), and all functions constituting the set o(f(n)) are higher order than f(n).

Because no function in o(f(n)) is the same order as a function w(f(n)), the sets are distinct.
This means that their intersect is the empty set.
