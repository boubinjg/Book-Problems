prove:
n! = o(n^n):
		n! (1*2*3*4*5...) will always be smaller than n^n for a given n.
		For any n, n! will never be greater than n^n, because they consist of the same
		number of multiplied terms, but the terms in n! start at one and increase each time,
		where the terms in n^n are always n, or the largest and final term in n!.
n! = w(2^n)
		n! is (almost) always greater than 2^n for the opposite reason as above.
		for n>3, n! will always be greater than 2^n because the multiplied terms in
		n! are larger than 2, and the product of the previous numbers (n-k)! is already larger
		than 2^(n-k).

lg(n!) = T(nlgn)
	lg(2^n) = 2^lg(n)
	lg(n^n) = n*lg(n)
	Because of the derivations above, we know that n! is o(n^n) and w(2^n). for lg(n!), the log of 
	the loose bounds produce functions of the form c*nlg(n), meaning that n! must be at greatest t(nlgn).
