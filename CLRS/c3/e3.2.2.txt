a^logb(c) = c^logb(a);

lgb( a ^ lgb(c)) = lgb(c) * lgb(a)

lgb(c^logb(a)) = lgb(c) * lgb(a)

By taking lgb of both sides, we can multiply the exponent by
lgb of the exponentiated term. The exponent and exponentiated term
in one situation is opposite of the other, so the equations returned
are lgb(c) * lgb(a), in either order. They are the same.
