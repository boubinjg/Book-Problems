All possible paths between a node and a leaf have to have the same black height. 
The shortest path between a node and leaf contains only black nodes.
The longest path contains exactly as many black nodes, but has one red node inbetween each black node.
You can have no more than 1 red node between each black node based on property 4.
That means that the longest possible path between a node and it's leaf is 
twice as long as the shortest possible path.
