Input: Two n-bit binary numbers
output: one n+1-bit binary number that equals the addition of the inputs.

Pseudocode:

AddNBits(num1, num2)
	ret[n+1] // ret is an array of size n+1
	carry = 0 // a number used to hold carry bits
	for i = n to 1
		if num1[i] and num2[i] and carry //both are true
			ret[i+1] = 1; //carry stays 1
		if num1[i] and num2[i] //both are true, hold is
			ret[i+1] = 0 
			carry = 1
		if not num1[i+1] and not num2[i] //both are false
			ret[i+1] = 0
			carry = 0
		else //if only one is true
			ret[i+1] = 1
			carry = 0
	ret[1] = carry
