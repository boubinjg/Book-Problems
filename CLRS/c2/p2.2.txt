To prove that bubblesort is correct, 
we have to prove that the invariant is correct.

The invariant for bubble sort is:
	the range up to i is sorted and contains the lowest
	values in the array.

Beginning:
	The size of the range is 0, so it can contain no elements.

Maintainence: 
	The loop J moves the largest value in the range i+1-j to the position i. 
	For all previous executions of the loop, the smallest value in its range would
	have already been placed, sorted, at the previous value of i, so the range is sorted
	and contains the smallest values in the range.

Termination:
	The range from 1 to A.length-1 contains the A-1 lowest values in sorted order.
	This means that the largest value in the range is at position A.length, 
	therefore that the range is sorted.


The worst case running time of bubblesort is n^2. This is the same as insertion sort, the difference
between the two is that insertion sort has a better average case.
