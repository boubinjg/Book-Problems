selection sort pseudocode:

SelectionSort(a):
	for i = 1 to a.length-1
		min = a[i]
		minIndex = i
		for j = i+2
			if a[j] < min
				minIndex = j
				min = a[j]
		a[minIndex] = a[i]
		a[i] = min

The loop invariant:
	For each iteration of the loop, the range of the array ending at index
	i-1 is sorted, and contains the smallest values in the collection.

We only have to run the algorithm to iteration A.length-1 because the last iteration
will automatically contain the largest element. In the last iteration of the loop,
a[1] to a[a.size-2] is a sorted range containing the smallest values in the collection.
This means that a[a.size-1] and a[a.size] are, in any order, the largest and second largest
values in the array. By plating the second largest value at the second last position, we
guarantee that the largest value is at the last position.
