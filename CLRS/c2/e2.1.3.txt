Pseudocode for linear search:

LinearSearch(A, val)
	for i = 1 to A.length
		if a[i] ==  val
			return i
		else
			i = i + 1
	return nil


Proof:

Invariant for for-loop: 
	at the start of each iteration of the loop, the index i of array a holds a valid value.

Initialization:
	i[0] is either a value in a, or a's length is 0 at which point our loop terminates

Maintenance:
	i[n] is a valid index in a. It's value is either val, and the function returns, or it is not,
	and i is incremented.

Termination:
	If i is greater than A.length, the loop terminates, meaning val is not in a.
