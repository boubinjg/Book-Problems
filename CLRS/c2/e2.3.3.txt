base case: 
	n = 2. logn(2) = 1, n = 2. nlogn = 2. 
induction step:
	for 2^k where k>1, the formula has 2 components.
		1: 2T(n/2) 
		2: n
	2T(n/2) will always be equal to (log(n)-1)*n. 
	Example 2^2:
		2T(2) + 4 := 2*2 + 4.
	Example 2^3:
		2T(4) + 8 = 16 + 8
	The process continues infinitely. 

For each power of 2, (log(n)-1)*n + n = nlogn.
