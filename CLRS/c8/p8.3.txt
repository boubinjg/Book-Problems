a) you can use radix sort. Simply sort the numbers by the ith digit in a loop as radix sort
does. To make this work, you should group numbers by number of digits and  sort each group 
of numbers individually.

b) do the same with strings, except you have to merge the sorted groups when you're done based
on first letter
