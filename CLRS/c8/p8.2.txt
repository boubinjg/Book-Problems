a) counting sort 
b) Hoare partition (not technically a sort for most cases, but here it works)
c) insertion sort

d) You can use any one that's stable, so a or c

e) You can create a count array using your O(k) extra space
   Then you loop through the original array starting at the back
   if an element is in its correct position, increment i, decrement the value in the  
   counting array, If the element isn't in its correct position, don't increment i, 
   and swap the element and the value in its correct position.
