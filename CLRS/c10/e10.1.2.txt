To implement two stacks using one array and use all of it's allocated memory, you could
place one stack's head at the first element of the array, and the other stack's head at the end of the array.

When data is pushed to the first stack, increment that stack's head value, and place the data there. When
data is pushed to the second stack, decrement the head value. When the two values are equal, the stack overflows.
