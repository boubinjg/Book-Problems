a)
A d-ary heap can be represented exactly like a binary heap but with
the child function would require some tinkering. 

p*n-(n-2) to p*n+1

b) for a d-ary heap the height is logd(n)

c) extract max is bounded by the height of the heap, so it 
would run in d*logd(n) time.

d) logd(n)

e) same as above
