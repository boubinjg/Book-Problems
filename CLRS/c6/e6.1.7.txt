A heap with n elements has height = h = floor(log(n)). 

This means that 2^h -1 = the max number of elements possibly in the heap.
2^(h-1)-1 elements of the heap are in the top rows of the heap, and
at most 2^(h-1) elements are in the last row.

This means that we can simply view the last half of elements
as the leives.
