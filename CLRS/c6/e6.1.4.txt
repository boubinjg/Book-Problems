The smallest element of a max-heap must be a leaf. The location of the leaf depends on when
it was added to the heap. It doesn't necessarily have to be in the lowest level of the heap,
but it must be in the lower two levels to satisfy the property that height(n) = floor(lg(n)).

For the smallest element to be an internal node, to satisfy the heap property, it would
by definition have to have a child of smaller value which is impossible if it is the
smallest node.
