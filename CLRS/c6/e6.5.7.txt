First in First out queue:
For every item in the queue, you can provide it priority equal to the order in which
it was placed in the queue, then return items based on that priority, not item value.

Stack:
You can do the opposite of a fifo queue. Provide each item a lower priority than the current top
and return the highest priority item based on that priority, not the value of the object.
