Insertion sort's best case is O(n) when running on a sorted input, as opposed to quicksort's n^2 time.
If a majority of inputs were sorted or near sorted, insertion sort would perform better on this 
majority of cases than quicksort. Insertion sort would then be the obvious choice to solve this problem.
