<13,19,9,5,12,8,7,4,11,2,6,21>
x = 13
i = 0
j = 13
loop through j
j = 11
loop through i
i = 1
<6,19,9,5,12,8,7,4,11,2,13,21>
loop through j
j = 10
loop through i
i = 2
<6,2,9,5,12,8,7,4,11,19,13,21>

terminate

B)
the first loop, (decrement j until a[j]<=x, will never access an element outside of
the array.  

Case 1: All elements are less than x. 
	the first and last index would swap, then J would equal the second to last index,
	and i would equal the last index, terminating the loop.
Case 2: All elements are greater than x.
	both i and j would be at index 1, and the loop would terminate
case 3: anything else
	for all other cases, i and j will find some numbers which satisfy their predicates.
	If both loops find satisfactory numbers and swap them, they are guaranteed to at least find
	one pair of numbers again in the array, but where i>j, which terminates the loop.
