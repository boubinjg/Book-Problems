q would be equal to the size of the array. This is the worst case. 

To output q as (p+r)/2, you could alternate between two if statements,
one that checks if v[j] <= pval if j is even, and one that checks if v[j] < pval
if j is odd.

Quicksort would operate in nlogn time instead of n^2 on arrays of equal elements.
