a)
cval = 'a' + 3;
'a' is promoted to an int, then the result is promoted to a char

b) 
fval = ui - ival * 1.0

ival is converted to a double, and ui is then converted to a double, then the result is converted to a floar

c)
dval = ui * fval

ui is converted to a float, then result is converted to double

d) 
cval = ival + fval + dval

ival is converted to float, then the result is converted to a double, then that result is converted to char
