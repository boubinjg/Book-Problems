string s = "word"

string p1 = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s";

The reason this doesnt compile is because + has pecedence over ==. 
The programmer wants to determine if the word ends with 's', but what actually happens is 
we concatenate the string s and its last letter, and compare that to the character 's' which is
not valid. The following line of code should work:

string p1 = s + (s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s");
