I do consider this an acceptable tradeoff. Programmers should be responsible for minimizing conditions which change the global state of a program, such as the use non-const global variables in function calls. By using good style, we can almost avoid entirely situations where evaluation order matters. Given that this should be a rare issue, efficiency (which is always an issue) should take precedence.
