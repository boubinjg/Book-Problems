a) False, a synthesized default will be provided if there is no other constructor

b) A default constructor can have default arguments, so this is false

c) I would say no. Default constructors are useful for things like the example in 7.44, vector initialization.
Leaving out a default constructor would limit you in that area.

d) False, this only happens if no constructor is defined.
