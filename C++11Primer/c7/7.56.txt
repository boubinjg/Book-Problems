Static class members are members which hold the same value for all instances of a class. They exist within
the scope of the class, but are independent of the class in that they exist for the life of the program. Static
members are useful in situations where you want an object which is the same for all class instances. Static members
are usually initialized outside of the class body, but still within the scope of the class. They can also be used
as default arguments unlike other data members.
