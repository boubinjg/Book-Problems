The code fragment in question is not legal. There is a problem in the second line. The first symbol in line two is
the output operator. The output operator is binary, and therefore requires two operands, one on either side.
While the output operator can act on operands on other lines than itself, line one is terminated with a semicolon. 
This means that the would be operand on line one is not accessible to the output operator so it can not function.
This behavior can also be seen between lines two and three.
