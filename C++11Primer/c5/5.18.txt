a) The loop tests cin as its condition which is not legal. To correct this, we should have the user input
a specific character which terminates the loop

b) In this loop, we declare a variable in the loop condition. This is illegal as the only place the
variable can be used is before its declared. To fix this:

int ival;
do{
 //...
}while(ival = get_response());

c) ival is declared outside of the scope of the loop condition.
To correct:

int ival;

do{
	ival = get_response();
}while(ival);
