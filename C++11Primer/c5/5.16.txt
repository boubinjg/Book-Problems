idiomatic for loop:
	//v is a vector of ints
	for(auto i : v)
		std::cout<<i<<std::endl;

	as a while:
	auto it = v.begin();
	while(it != v.end())
	{
		std::cout<<*it<<std::endl;
		++it;
	}


idiomatic while loop:
//s is a string
	while(cin>>s)
		std::cout<<s<<std::endl;

	as a for loop:

	for(std::string s; cin>>s; )
		std::cout<<s<<std::endl;


If I could only use one of these loops, I would choose the for loop. The for adds extra functionality, like
allowing the declaration of variables and providing a range option for iterating over containers.
