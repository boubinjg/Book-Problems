a) ix is declared in the loop init statement, but used outside of the loops scope. This is illegal
to correct:
	int ix;
	for(ix = 0; ix != sz; ix++) {/* */}
	if(ix != sz)
		//...

b) in b, ix is not initialized and therefore cant be compared to sz; 
to correct:
	int ix;
	for(ix = 0; ix != sz; ix++) {/* */}
	
c) For this loop to terminate, ix must be modified in the loop body, or sz must initially
equal 0; Under many circumstances, ix and sz will never be equal if they are both incremented 
in every iteration.
