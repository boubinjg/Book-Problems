The differences between short, int, long, and long long are the number of bytes allocated for each type. G++ designates 16 bits for a short, 32 bits for int and long int, and 64 bits for long long int. A float stores floatin point numbers in a 32 bit area. Doubles use double the space, or 64 bits. Signed variables are capable of storing negative values, unsigned variables are not; however, unsigned variables are capable of representing higher values than signed variables.
