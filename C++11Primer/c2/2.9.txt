a) Incorrect, you can't declare an uninitialized variable and apply an operator to it at the same time

b) Incorrect, 3.14 is a 64 bit double, and i is an int. Usually this would be possible, but the list initialization will not work with narrowing conversions, such as converting a double to an int

c) This works, but only if wage is initialized.

d) Correct, narrowing conversion works in this regard.
