a) vec does not have enough elements to hold the copied version of lst. To fix this, we can use
a back inserter to vec instead of vec.begin() in the call to copy.

b) simply reserving space does not provide iterable elements for fill_n to replace. These three lines could
be reduced to simply:
	vector<int> vec(10);
