hp = hp2: 
	hp2 is copy-swapped into hp. hp is copied using the copy constructor, then its values are
	swapped using the classes swap function into hp. hp2 is unchanged.

hp = std::move(hp2):
	hp's members are set to hp2's members (ps and i). Then hp2's dynamic members (ps)
	are nullified and deleted after hp2 goes out of scope. `
