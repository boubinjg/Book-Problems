- C++ has evolved from a simple C extension

- C++ is multiparadigm, supporting procedural, OO, functional, generic, and metaprogramming paradigms.

4 sublanguages:
	C
	OO C++
	Template C++
	the STL

- pass by value is usually faster for c builtin types, but not for C++ class objects

- rules for effective programming depend on which sublanguage you are using.
