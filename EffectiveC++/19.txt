treat class design like type design

Questions to ask during class design:

is a new type really what you need?
how should objects be created/destroyed
how should object initialization differ from assignment
what does it mean for an object of this type to be passed by value?
what are the restrictions on legal values of this type?
does this type fit into an inheritance hierarchy?
what kind of type conversions are allowed? (also think about implicit conversions)
what operations and functions make sense for the new type?
what standard functions should be disallowed?
what should have access to the members of your new type?
what is the undeclared interface of this type?
how general is this type?
